    "I have had my Instagram account since 2012, which means I was around 9 years old at the time I created it. As many people, when creating an Instagram account the first people I followed was my family members and friends. However, as time went by, I started following famous people, business accounts, and more. \n",

    "Throughout these last 11 years, I believe that among the top 20 most liked accoounts, I liked more celebrity posts than family and friend's posts. Even though I follow family and friends for a longer time, I do believe I don't like their content as much because they to post less than celebrities. The majority of he famous people I follow post almost every single day, if not more than once a day. In the meantime, I have some friends that post constantly every week or so, but many of them don't post often. So, my hypothesis is that I like celebrities content more than my family/friends' content. "

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "My hypothesis of me liking more celebrities than family and friends' content was correct, as the ratio between them is nearly 7.5:1.\n",
    "\n",
    "The limitations of using only the liked_posts for this analysis is that it only focuses on reels and posts, not on stories. Hence, for a more specific result on which type of accounts and specific users I normally like and engage more would be interesting to analize the story_likes.json file as well, which has data of every story I liked. Not only the users on top 20 could change completely with this added information, but the ratio between family/friends and celebrities posts could change by a lot. Plus, as I have an additional account in which I follow authors, that in my perspective are considered celebrities if they are famous ones, it would also be of value to this analysis if I got the data for this other account to use it in the report. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is also necessary to take into account that there were years that I barely used this Instagram account and that some of them I used more my other account, which can have an influence on the results. In addition, reels was only introduced in the past few years, which means that is a difference between past and present state of the platform important to have in mind.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way of testing my hypothesis would be creating a list with the people I consider my family and friends and another list with people who are celebrities, generating a code that could calculate the result so I do not need to make the calculation by myself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the next steps for further investigating this hypothesis would be getting data on my additional account along with using story_likes.json to have a broader idea of my most liked accounts. Plus, creating a code that could detect each user and fit them in their respective category, so the calculation could be done with code as well. With such code instructions, it would be even possible to expand the hypothesis to not only inside my top 20 most liked accounts, but to every account I liked. And the hypothesis could be even narrowed down to the ratio I believe it will have between them including this other data."
